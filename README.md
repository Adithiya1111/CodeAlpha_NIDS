# ðŸš¨ Snort NIDS Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) on Kali Linux using **Snort 3**. The system detects ICMP (ping) packets and raises alerts.

---

## ðŸ§° Configuration Files

- `snort.lua`: The Snort 3 configuration file
- `local.rules`: Contains a custom ICMP alert rule

---

## ðŸ§ª Tested Environment

- **OS**: Kali Linux (running inside VMWare Workstation)
- **Snort Version**: 3.1.82.0
- **Interface**: `eth0`
- **Mode**: Passive detection

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
sudo snort -c snort.lua -R local.rules -i eth0 --daq afpacket --daq-mode passive -A alert_fast


âœ… Step-by-Step: Run Snort 3 NIDS on Linux
===============================================================================================================

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Verify Snort 3 Installation
Make sure Snort is installed and working:

snort -V
âœ… You should see version info like: Snort++ 3.1.x.x (Paste the commands on Linux Terminal)

If not installed, install it:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create Configuration Files
Create config directory (if not already):

sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/rules

Create the Snort configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.lua
Paste this:

HOME_NET = '192.168.146.97/24'  -- Replace with your VM's IP(See below to find ip)

ips = {
  enable_builtin_rules = true,
  include = '/etc/snort/rules/local.rules'
}

daq = {
  module = 'afpacket',
  interface = 'eth0',
  mode = 'passive'
}

decode = {}
search_engine = {}
stream = {}
reassembly = {}
file_id = {}

alert_fast = {
  file = true
}

Save and exit with CTRL + O, Enter, CTRL + X.

To find IP, Type "ip a" on your terminal
-----------------------------------------

Hereâ€™s a typical output of ip a:

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default 
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 86375sec preferred_lft 86375sec
    inet6 fe80::aabb:ccff:fedd:eeff/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
Explanation of Key Parts:
lo: The loopback interface (used for local communication).

eth0: A physical or virtual Ethernet interface.

inet 192.168.1.100/24: The IPv4 address and subnet mask.

inet6 fe80::...: The IPv6 address.

state UP: Interface is active.

link/ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff: MAC address of the interface.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create your custom rule file:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Paste this rule:

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ðŸš¨ My Custom ICMP Rule Triggered"; sid:1001337; rev:1;)
Save and exit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Check Interface Name
Run:

ip a
Find the active interface name (e.g., eth0 or ens33).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Run Snort with Config

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -R /etc/snort/rules/local.rules -i eth0 --daq afpacket --daq-mode passive -A alert_fast
âœ… Replace eth0 with your actual interface name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Test Snort Detection
From another device (or your host PC), ping the Kali VM:

ping <Kali_VM_IP>
Example:
bash
ping 192.168.146.97

Snort should output alerts like:

[**] [1:1001337:1] "ðŸš¨ My Custom ICMP Rule Triggered" [**] {ICMP} 192.168.146.171 -> 192.168.146.97

File Extension of .lua and .rules
------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ .lua Extension â€“ snort.lua
What it is:
The .lua file is a configuration file written in the Lua programming language. In this context, it's specifically used for Snort 3, a popular Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).

Purpose in your project:
The snort.lua file is used to configure how Snort operates. It defines:

The network range (HOME_NET)

The interface and DAQ module Snort should listen on

Which rules to load (local.rules)

Basic modules like decode, stream, and file_id

Output format (e.g., alert_fast)

Example from your file:

lua

ips = {
  enable_builtin_rules = true,
  include = '/etc/snort/rules/local.rules'
}
This line tells Snort to use its built-in rules and also load custom rules from the local.rules file.

ðŸ”¹ .rules Extension â€“ local.rules
What it is:
The .rules file is a plain text file used to define custom detection rules for Snort. Each line typically represents a rule to detect certain types of traffic, such as suspicious packets or patterns.

Purpose in your project:
This file contains your custom detection logic. In your case, it defines a rule to alert when ICMP (ping) packets are detected.

Example from your file:

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ðŸš¨ My Custom ICMP Rule Triggered"; sid:1001337; rev:1;)
This rule tells Snort to:

Alert on any ICMP packet from any source to any destination

Display the message "ðŸš¨ My Custom ICMP Rule Triggered"

Use a unique Snort ID (SID) of 1001337
